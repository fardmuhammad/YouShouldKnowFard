A "You Don't Know Jack" reproduction that I wrote in July 2011 to create a Flash-based mini game- 
using imagery, animation, music, voice samples, and sound effects from the YDKJ series as well as ones created/recorded by me. 

You can view the project in a working state at http://www.channel-78.com/YSKF

This project was created before I was introduced to Jellyvision/Jackbox Games internal mechanisms for creating YDKJ and other games when
I worked there as a contractor in 2011-2012, and any code that is in any way similar to theirs is purely coincidental. The sound effects
and music include copyrighted tracks from the YDKJ series, and will not be made available here. This is simply to show the AS3 code
structure.
